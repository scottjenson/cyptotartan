# Cypto Tartan
Visual tartan-like representation of a 64 byte digital signature

At Future Insights, David Dahl had a great idea to represent a 64 byte digital signature as a 4x4 grid of color squares, a type of 'gravatar for your signature. The problem was that it wasn't very friendly to color blind people. This is a JS Canvas test to create a more subtle version that uses color, line width, and opacity to create a cloth like weave effect that is still unique but not dependent on color.

This version is my first test and very crude. It uses random numbers, the only way to get a new pattern is to refresh the page. However, I wanted something quick and dirty to see if it was remotely close/reasonable. If it makes sense, we can mature it, add a decoder, etc.
